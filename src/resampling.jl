# Description of the stratified CV algorithm:
#
# There are algorithms that are conceptually somewhat simpler than this
# algorithm, but this algorithm is O(n) and is invariant to relabelling
# of the target vector.
#
# 1) Use countmap() to get the count for each level.
#
# 2) Use unique() to get the order in which the levels appear. (Steps 1
# and 2 could be combined if countmap() used an OrderedDict.)
#
# 3) For y = ['b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'a'],
# the levels occur in the order ['b', 'c', 'a'], and each level has a count
# of 4. So imagine a table like this:
#
# b b b b c c c c a a a a
# 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3
#
# This table ensures that the levels are smoothly spread across the test folds.
# In other words, where one level leaves off, the next level picks up. So,
# for example, as the 'c' levels are encountered, the corresponding row indices
# are added to folds [2, 3, 1, 2], in that order. The table above is
# partitioned by y-level and put into a dictionary `fold_lookup` that maps
# levels to the corresponding array of fold indices.
#
# 4) Iterate i from 1 to length(rows). For each i, look up the corresponding
# level, i.e. `level = y[rows[i]]`. Then use `popfirst!(fold_lookup[level])`
# to find the test fold in which to put the i-th element of `rows`.
#
# 5) Concatenate the appropriate test folds together to get the train
# indices for each `(train, test)` pair.

Estimate the performance of a machine `mach` wrapping a supervised
model in data, using the specified `resampling` strategy (defaulting
to 6-fold cross-validation) and `measure`, which can be a single
measure or vector.

Do `subtypes(MLJ.ResamplingStrategy)` to obtain a list of available
resampling strategies. If `resampling` is not an object of type
`MLJ.ResamplingStrategy`, then a vector of pairs (of the form
`(train_rows, test_rows)` is expected. For example, setting

    resampling = [(1:100), (101:200)),
                   (101:200), (1:100)]

gives two-fold cross-validation using the first 200 rows of data.

The resampling strategy is applied repeatedly if `repeats > 1`. For
`resampling = CV(nfolds=5)`, for example, this generates a total of
`5n` test folds for evaluation and subsequent aggregation.

If `resampling isa MLJ.ResamplingStrategy` then one may optionally
restrict the data used in evaluation by specifying `rows`.

An optional `weights` vector may be passed for measures that support
sample weights (`MLJ.supports_weights(measure) == true`), which is
ignored by those that don't.

*Important:* If `mach` already wraps sample weights `w` (as in `mach =
machine(model, X, y, w)`) then these weights, which are used for
*training*, are automatically passed to the measures for
evaluation. However, for evaluation purposes, any `weights` specified
as a keyword argument will take precedence over `w`.

User-defined measures are supported; see the manual for details.

If no measure is specified, then `default_measure(mach.model)` is
used, unless this default is `nothing` and an error is thrown.

The `acceleration` keyword argument is used to specify the compute resource (a
subtype of `ComputationalResources.AbstractResource`) that will be used to
accelerate/parallelize the resampling operation.

Although evaluate! is mutating, `mach.model` and `mach.args` are
untouched.

### Return value

A property-accessible object of type `PerformanceEvaluation` with
these properties:

- `measure`: the vector of specified measures

- `measurements`: the corresponding measurements, aggregated across the
  test folds using the aggregation method defined for each measure (do
  `aggregation(measure)` to inspect)

- `per_fold`: a vector of vectors of individual test fold evaluations
  (one vector per measure)

- `per_observation`: a vector of vectors of individual observation
  evaluations of those measures for which
  `reports_each_observation(measure)` is true, which is otherwise
  reported `missing`.

Resampling model wrapper, used internally by the `fit` method of
`TunedModel` instances. See [`evaluate!](@ref) for options. Not
intended for general use.

Given a machine `mach = machine(resampler, args...)` one obtains a
performance evaluation of the specified `model`, performed according
to the prescribed `resampling` strategy and other parameters, using
data `args...`, by calling `fit!(mach)` followed by
`evaluate(mach)`. The advantage over using `evaluate(model, X, y)` is
that the latter call always calls `fit` on the `model` but
`fit!(mach)` only calls `update` after the first call.

The sample `weights` are passed to the specified performance
measures that support weights for evaluation.

*Important:* If `weights` are left unspecified, then any weight vector
`w` used in constructing the resampler machine, as in
`resampler_machine = machine(resampler, X, y, w)` (which is then used
in *training* the model) will also be used in evaluation.
